R has a beautiful set of plotting capabilities that allow it to produce
publication-quality graphs very easily and quickly. A commonly used package for
making graphs in R is called ggplot2. This "Grammar of Graphics" package (hence 'gg')
has become very popular beacuse it has great documentation, tutorials, and cheatsheets 
(see the Resources links on the bottom), in addition to it being fairly easy to learn and use.

So let's get started. Load up the package:


{% highlight r %}
library(ggplot2)
{% endhighlight %}

Before starting, there is major assumption here for making plots: that your data
is already cleaned up and tidy, ready for plotting and analysis. If it isn't,
finish that part of your work first!

Let's look over two datasets. I'm using two here because one contains a lot of
continuous data (swiss) and the other contains more discrete data (mpg). Use
`colnames` to look at the column names of your dataset:


{% highlight r %}
colnames(swiss)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
#> [1] "Fertility"        "Agriculture"      "Examination"     
#> [4] "Education"        "Catholic"         "Infant.Mortality"
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight r %}
colnames(mpg)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
#>  [1] "manufacturer" "model"        "displ"        "year"        
#>  [5] "cyl"          "trans"        "drv"          "cty"         
#>  [9] "hwy"          "fl"           "class"
{% endhighlight %}

Alright, let's do some simple plotting here. Standard plots include:

- Line graph
- Scatterplot
- Scatterplot with a regression/smoothing line
- Barplot
- Boxplot

The nice thing about ggplot2 is it is based on layers. You start with the base
`ggplot` function, and using `+` you add additional layers with the `geom_`
commands. Each type of layer ends in the type it is trying to create; so a line
graph would be `geom_line`, a scatterplot would be `geom_point`, a bar would be
`geom_bar`, and so on. Where you put the `geom_` in the layer will dictate where
it will be placed on the final plot. The other thing to use in ggplot2 is the
`aes` command, which stands for the aesthetics... or rather, what data and
values you *actually* want to plot. So `aes(x = Height, y = Weight)` would put
Height on the x-axis and Weight on the y-axis. Let's try it out.

## Common plots

### Line graph: Fertility by Agriculture


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(swiss, aes(x = Fertility, y = Agriculture)) +
    geom_line()
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk lineplot]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/lineplot-1.png)

### Scatterplot: Education by Examination


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(swiss, aes(x = Education, y = Examination)) +
    geom_point()
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk scatterplot]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/scatterplot-1.png)

### Scatterplot with regression/smoothing lin: Education by Examination

Using [loess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_regression) smoothing line:


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(swiss, aes(x = Education, y = Examination)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth()
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
#> `geom_smooth()` using method = 'loess'
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk smooth]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/smooth-1.png)

... or a simple linear regression line:


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(swiss, aes(x = Education, y = Examination)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm') # lm = linear model
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk lmsmooth]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/lmsmooth-1.png)

### Barplot: Number of vehicle types (class)


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class)) +
    geom_bar()
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk barplot]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/barplot-1.png)

### Boxplot: Vehicle type (class) by highway miles/gallon (hwy)


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = class, y = hwy)) +
    geom_boxplot()
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk boxplot]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/boxplot-1.png)

### Sub-dividing up your plot: 

Let's plot drive type (4-wheel, front, rear) by highway mpg by number of
cylinders.


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_grid(~ cyl)
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk facet_boxplot]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/facet_boxplot-1.png)

The 'facet_grid()' function specifies which variable to sub-divide by - in this case 'cyl'.
By coding (~ cyl), the figure will subdivide by columns, whereas if you coded it as 
(cyl ~), it will subdivide by rows. 


There are dozens of types of layers (`geom_`) that you can use and the
documentation is incredible! So if there is a plot you want to make, you
definitely can do it in R!

## Customizing your plots:

Default, using density plot (which shows the distribution of a continuous
variable, useful for assessing skewness):

Note: `fill` tells ggplot2 how to fill in groups with a colour.


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, fill = drv)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3) # alpha = transparency
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk densityplot]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/densityplot-1.png)

Adding a different colour (using the `scale_` group of commands; since `fill` is
used, it would be `scale_fill_` and since one of the colour palettes is called
`brewer`, it turns into `scale_fill_brewer`). You can see the different choices
for palettes by running `?scale_fill_brewer` to look at the help file.


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, fill = drv)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Dark2')
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

Similarly, you can use the `scale_` function to make changes to the legend.


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, fill = drv)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Dark2') +
      scale_fill_discrete(name = "drivetrain", 
                      breaks = c("4", "f", "r"), 
                      labels = c("Four wheel", 
                                 "Front wheel", 
                                 "Rear Wheel")) 
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
#> Scale for 'fill' is already present. Adding another scale for 'fill',
#> which will replace the existing scale.
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)


Using `labs` will allow you to modify or add titles to the figure.


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, fill = drv)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Dark2') +
    ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, fill = drv)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Pastel1') +
      scale_fill_discrete(name = "drivetrain", 
                      breaks = c("4", "f", "r"), 
                      labels = c("Four wheel", 
                                 "Front wheel", 
                                 "Rear Wheel")) +
    labs(title = "Fuel Economy", 
         x = "Engine Displacement", 
         y = "Highway Mileage")
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
#> Error: Don't know how to add o to a plot
{% endhighlight %}


And to customize individual features of the plot, you use `theme`. The `theme`
options are quite extensive, so if you want to look more into it, check out
`?theme` or the very detailed documentation
[here](http://docs.ggplot2.org/dev/vignettes/themes.html). There is a nice
graphic right above "Complete and incomplete theme objects" section, near the
bottom of the web document.


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = hwy, fill = drv)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.3) +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = 'Dark2') +
      scale_fill_discrete(name = "drivetrain", 
                      breaks = c("4", "f", "r"), 
                      labels = c("Four wheel", 
                                 "Front wheel", 
                                 "Rear Wheel")) +
        labs(title = "Fuel Economy", 
             x = "Engine Displacement", 
             y = "Highway Mileage") +
    theme(panel.border = element_blank(), # panel = background of the entire plot
          panel.background = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = 'grey90'),
          legend.position = 'top',
          line = element_line(colour = 'black'),
          axis.line.y = element_line(colour = 'black'),
          axis.line.x = element_line(colour = 'black'))
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
#> Scale for 'fill' is already present. Adding another scale for 'fill',
#> which will replace the existing scale.
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-6]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)


Another example:


{% highlight r %}
ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = drv)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Fuel Economy", 
       x = "Engine Displacement", 
       y = "Highway Mileage") +
  theme_bw(base_family = "Times") +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 18), 
        axis.title = element_text(size = 14), 
        axis.text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  annotate("text", x = 6, y = 40, label = "p <0.05", 
           size = 7)
{% endhighlight %}

![plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-7]({{ site.github.url }}/images/2016-10-26-Plotting/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)


Finally, assign your figure code a name and save it as an individual file using `ggsave`.


{% highlight r %}
ggsave("C:/Users/identify-the-path-you-want-to-save-in/nameyourfigure.png", nameoffigureyouassigned,
       device = "png", dpi = 600, width = 7, height = 8)
{% endhighlight %}



{% highlight text %}
#> Error in grid.draw(plot): object 'nameoffigureyouassigned' not found
{% endhighlight %}
