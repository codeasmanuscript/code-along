## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r captions}
library(captioner)
tab_nums <- captioner(prefix = "Table")
tab1 <- tab_nums("tab1", "This is the caption for table 1. Looking at the regression from the swiss dataset.")
#tab1

fig_nums <- captioner(prefix = "Figure")
fig1 <- fig_nums("fig1", "This is a caption for figure 1, showing a scatter plot.")
```

If you want to see the results, see `r tab_nums("tab1", display = 'cite')`.

```{r table}
library(pander)
pander(lm(Fertility ~ Education, data = swiss), caption = tab1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots here (see `r fig_nums("fig1", display = "cite")`), for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=fig1}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Inline numbers `r round(mean(swiss$Fertility), 2)`

# Citations

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(curl)
curl_download("http://codeasmanuscript.github.io/code-along/misc/sample.bib", "sample.bib")
curl_download("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citation-style-language/styles/master/american-medical-association.csl", "ama.csl")
