  Abstract                 = {High-dimensional longitudinal data involving latent variables such as depression and anxiety that cannot be quantified directly are often encountered in biomedical and social sciences. Multiple responses are used to characterize these latent quantities, and repeated measures are collected to capture their trends over time. Furthermore, substantive research questions may concern issues such as interrelated trends among latent variables that can only be addressed by modeling them jointly. Although statistical analysis of univariate longitudinal data has been well developed, methods for modeling multivariate high-dimensional longitudinal data are still under development. In this paper, we propose a latent factor linear mixed model ({LFLMM)} for analyzing this type of data. This model is a combination of the factor analysis and multivariate linear mixed models. Under this modeling framework, we reduced the high-dimensional responses to low-dimensional latent factors by the factor analysis model, and then we used the multivariate linear mixed model to study the longitudinal trends of these latent factors. We developed an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the model. We used simulation studies to investigate the computational properties of the expectation-maximization algorithm and compare the {LFLMM} model with other approaches for high-dimensional longitudinal data analysis. We used a real data example to illustrate the practical usefulness of the model. Copyright {\^{A}}{\copyright} 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Austin Bradford Hill offers a general heuristic for causal inference in epidemiology, but no general heuristic for prediction is available. This paper seeks to identify a heuristic for predicting the outcome of interventions on population health, informed by the moral context of such interventions. It is suggested that, where available, robust predictions should be preferred, where a robust prediction is one which, according to the best knowledge we are currently able to obtain, could not easily be wrong. To assess whether a prediction is robust, it is suggested that we ask why the predicted outcome will occur, rather than any other outcome. Firstly, if, according to our current knowledge, we cannot identify the likeliest ways that the other outcomes could occur, then the prediction is not robust. And secondly, if, according to our current knowledge, we can identify the likeliest other outcomes but we are unable to say why our predicted outcome will occur rather than these, then, again, our prediction is not robust. Otherwise, it is robust. The inaccurate but memorable short version of the heuristic is, "What could possibly go wrong?"},

  Abstract                 = {Epidemiologic research is an exercise in measurement. Observational epidemiologic results usually include a point estimate, a measure of random error such as a frequentist confidence interval, and a qualitative discussion of study limitations. Without randomization of study subjects to exposure groups, inference from study results requires an educated guess about the strength of the systematic errors compared with the strength of the exposure effects. Although quantitative methods to make these educated guesses exist, the conventional approach is qualitative, which reduces the educated guessing to a problem of reasoning under uncertainty. In circumstances such as these, humans predictably reason poorly. Heuristics and resulting biases that simplify the judgmental tasks tend to underestimate the systematic error, underestimate the uncertainty, and focus the inference on the study's specific evidence while excluding countervailing external information. Common warnings to interpret results with trepidation are an ineffective solution. The methods that quantify systematic error and uncertainty challenge the analyst to specify the alternative explanations for associations that are otherwise too readily judged causal.},
