In general, these workshops are intended assuming very little knowledge of R. So
*all* are welcome, no matter your skill, knowledge, or experience level!

Also, you are welcome to come with your *own data* so you can try the commands
to see your own results!

## Installing

Before coming to the workshop, please make sure to download and install:

- [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/index.html), or more directly (assuming **64 bit** computer):
    - [For Windows users](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-3.3.2-win.exe)
    - [For Mac users](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.3.2.pkg)
    - For Linux users, the steps to install, though easy, depend on your distribution
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), or more directly (again, assuming **64 bit**):
    - [For Windows users](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.136.exe)
    - [For Mac users](https://download1.rstudio.org/RStudio-1.0.136.dmg)
    - For Linux users, again it will depend on your distribution, but [here is for Ubuntu](https://download1.rstudio.org/rstudio-1.0.136-amd64.deb)
    
After downloaded, make sure to **install** each using your operating system's
(e.g. Windows) standard procedure (e.g. running the `.exe` file for Windows
users).

## Installing packages

Each topic may have an requirement to (preferably) install a R package
beforehand. If you aren't familiar with installing packages, in RStudio, click
the `Tools -> Install Packages...` menu option. In the pop up, typing the
package suggested to install and hit Enter.

If you are a bit familiar with installing packages in R, you can just copy and
paste the command listed in the `Package(s) to install` item in the session
listing.
